Here are some hands-on project ideas for working with Amazon EC2:

1. **Basic Web Server Setup:**
   - Launch an EC2 instance.
   - Install a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).
   - Deploy a simple static website or web application.

2. **Database Server Deployment:**
   - Set up an EC2 instance.
   - Install a database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Configure remote access and connect to the database from your local machine or another EC2 instance.

3. **Load Balancer Configuration:**
   - Launch multiple EC2 instances.
   - Set up an application on each instance.
   - Configure an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic among the instances.

4. **Auto Scaling Group:**
   - Create a launch configuration or template for EC2 instances.
   - Set up an Auto Scaling Group to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.

5. **Security Groups and Network ACLs:**
   - Launch an EC2 instance.
   - Create and configure security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.

6. **Custom AMI Creation:**
   - Launch and configure an EC2 instance with specific software and settings.
   - Create a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the configured instance.
   - Launch new instances using the custom AMI.

7. **CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code:**
   - Write a CloudFormation template to automate the deployment of EC2 instances and related resources.
   - Use the template to launch and manage your infrastructure.

8. **Bastion Host Setup:**
   - Launch a public EC2 instance as a bastion host.
   - Configure it to allow SSH access to private instances within a VPC.

9. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set up CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instance metrics (CPU usage, memory, etc.).
   - Create CloudWatch alarms to send notifications based on certain thresholds.

10. **Application Deployment with CI/CD:**
    - Integrate EC2 with a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeDeploy.
    - Automate the deployment of an application to EC2 instances.

These projects will help you gain practical experience with various aspects of EC2 and related AWS services.
